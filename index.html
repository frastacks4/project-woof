      <p>The Bernese shares similar distinctive coloring with the other varieties of Swiss Mountain Dog, but it is the only one of the four to have a long, silky coat. The Bernese worked as drovers and draft dogs as well as watchdogs in the farmyards, mainly in the Canton of Berne, Switzerland..</p>
